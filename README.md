This repository contains the code that was used to perform the environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of the SpiralG biorefinery. This work was conducted in the frame of the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE-JU) project "SpiralG" that started in 2018 and ended in 2023. This project aimed at revisiting the Spirulina value chain to convert the residual biomass obtained after phycocyanin extraction into ingredients for food, feed, cosmetics, and agricultural products. The work on LCA corresponded to the work package 5 of SpiralG and aimed at (1) identifying hotpsots in the Spirulina value chain and (2) evaluate whether the technological improvements and knowledge gained on the biomass and conversion processes led to a reduction of the climate impacts between 2019 and 2022 by at least 10%.
