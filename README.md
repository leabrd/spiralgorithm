This repository contains the code that was used to perform the **environmental life cycle assessment (LCA)** of the SpiralG biorefinery. This work was conducted in the frame of the **Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE-JU) project "SpiralG"** that started in 2018 and ended in 2023.

This project aimed at **revisiting the Spirulina value chain** to convert the residual biomass obtained after phycocyanin extraction into ingredients for food, feed, cosmetics, and agricultural products. The work on LCA corresponded to the work package 5 of SpiralG and aimed at (1) identifying **hotpsots** in the Spirulina value chain and (2) evaluate whether the **technological improvements** and **knowledge gained** on the biomass and conversion processes led to a reduction of the climate impacts between 2019 and 2022 by at least 10%. More information on the project can be found at: https://www.spiralg.eu/.
